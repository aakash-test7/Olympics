## 📘 Project Overview

The **Olympics 2024 Insight Platform** is a full-featured, cloud-integrated web application designed to provide interactive access to detailed data from the Paris 2024 Olympics. Built for athletes, analysts, and sports enthusiasts, the project enables users to:

- 📊 Explore real-time Olympic data across disciplines, athletes, and countries
- 🥇 Predict medal outcomes using simulation logic
- 🤖 Interact with an intelligent chatbot to retrieve event-specific insights
- ☁️ Access data efficiently via Google Cloud Platform for scalability and performance

This application is built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, with all datasets hosted on **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**, ensuring robust cloud-native data handling and modular development.

## ☁️ Cloud Architecture & Data Pipeline

### ✅ Why Google Cloud Platform?

The application leverages **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** as its backbone for storing and managing Olympic datasets. This cloud-native infrastructure ensures:

- **High Performance**: Fast retrieval of structured data using GCP Buckets
- **Scalability**: Seamless scaling of resources as the application and dataset sizes grow
- **Maintainability**: Decouples storage from compute logic, enhancing modular development
- **Accessibility**: Allows multiple application modules to securely and centrally access CSV files stored on the cloud

### 🔁 Workflow

1. **Data Upload**: Cleaned datasets are uploaded to GCP Cloud Storage buckets.
2. **Data Access**: The `cloud.py` module handles secure and efficient access to GCS from the Streamlit app.
3. **Processing**: Data is parsed, filtered, and visualized in real time within Streamlit pages.
4. **Usage**: Users interact with predictions, visualizations, and a chatbot to gain insights.

## 💡 Features in Detail

### 🥇 Medal Prediction Engine

- **Purpose**: Allow athletes and analysts to simulate expected medal outcomes based on current event participation and historical patterns.
- **Implementation**:
  - Input: Athlete name, event, or country
  - Logic: Rule-based heuristic modeling based on medals_total.csv and medallists.csv
  - Output: Simulated medal standing

### 📈 Dataset Visualization

- Interactive exploration of:
  - Athlete participation across countries and sports
  - Medal tallies by country, gender, and discipline
  - Venue usage timelines
  - Event-specific historical data

### 💬 Olympic Chatbot

- **Technology**: Powered by **Google Cloud APIs** and **Gemini (Google’s multimodal generative AI)** for intelligent, context-aware interaction
- **Architecture**:
  - Gemini handles natural language understanding and generation
  - Google Cloud Functions/API endpoints enable dynamic retrieval of structured data from GCP storage
- **Capabilities**:
  - 📆 **Answer complex event-specific queries**, such as:
    - "Who won gold in Judo?"
    - "What time is the Archery final?"
  - 🗺️ **Retrieve venue and location data** (e.g., where an event is being held)
  - 🏅 **Explain sport rules, athlete bios, and competition formats**
  - 🧠 Contextual memory: Understands follow-up questions in a conversation thread
- **Scalability**: As Gemini is hosted via Google Cloud, the chatbot benefits from scalability, low latency, and high availability
